    "In the following, you will find some examples for each type of implemented statistical analysis, including the corresponding plotting and annotation functions. Currently, the implemented analyses are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comparison of two or more independent samples\n",
    "2. Comparison of one group to a reference value\n",
    "3. Mixed-Model ANOVA (comparison of two or more groups with repeated measures)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This package relies heavily on the correct design of the input data. Therefore, please take some time before using one of the implemented functionalities and make sure you got the input data organized in the right way. In general, this packages requires the input data to be organized in the so-called \"long format\" with a fixed column order. Please check out the \"Expected input data format\" section for the respective test for detailed information."
